A collection of python software that all runs on the raspberry pi device. This workshop is ~~offered once a year, check http://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/ to see when it will be offered in the summer~~ is no longer offered to my knowledge, but may return. I will keep this repo up though as I have an irrational fear of deleting anything that I even have the slightest of chances of using again. 

Most games come from the preloaded games on the raspberry pi RasbianOS but some were downloaded from pygame.org's website. I did not write any of the games and if you are the author of any of them and would like me to take it down please let me know via an issue request(though I tried to ensure I only grab games whose licenses allowed me to use them in this manner). I like to include complete games as modifying already made games is a quick way for kids to get their hands dirty fast and see the results. Sure, that result is mostly just applying Nicholas Cages head to the bunny eating game(a change done so much in my class that it is now included in the repo) but it's better feedback than writing print statements!
