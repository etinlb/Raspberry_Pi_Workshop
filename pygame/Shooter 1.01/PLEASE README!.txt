=Shooter v.1.1 made by Besktrap=
=========================

Updates!
- "Score board" added, although having trouble being able to set it's location (color changes also added when you reach certain scores)

Description:

Python and Pygame are needed to run this program.
So, basically, this program is just a test for a future
games. I'm going to add events such as
MOUSEBUTTONDOWN collisions with the Donkey
Kong sprite and "hopefully" a timer. I used
Dexter Roderick's (luster123 from pygame.org)
"Silent.wav" sound and speeded it up by %200,
using it as the shot sound. BTW, anyone notice
the color of the lines everytime the program is started?

CONTROLS:

Mouse- use it to move the aimer, and click it to shoot (Left mouse button)
